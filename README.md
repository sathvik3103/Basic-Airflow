Getting started with Apache Airflow and it's TaskFlow API using a simple sequential mathematical operations to get started and understand the concepts

This Repository consists of 3 main .py files in **dags** folder which are my hands-on with Apache Airfloqw and TaskFlow API for the first time. 

I learnt how to define 
  1. tasks
  2. sequence of tasks
  3. how to use Airflow's TaskFlow API to write tasks cleaner without needing to manually use operators like PythonOperator and use decorators like @task.
  4. how to initiate airflow and work with the airflow ui on local host

You can see how quickly see the output screenshots of these simple airflow pipelines in the /outputs folder
